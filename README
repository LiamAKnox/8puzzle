8PUZZLE:******************************************************************
**************************************************************************

first project using personal linux

goals:
* represents current focus

*-make vs code work for this linux and project
-create the 8puzzle game
	-standard 8puzzzle game
	-adjustable size (seperated height and width)
	-possibly storing scores
	-possibly making a visual display for the game
	-using trees, offer the best solution to the puzzle
-have the game run through a Makefile
-using trees find all possible board layouts
-perhaps figure out how to implement a touch screen


***************************
current thought process:
***************************
-use an array of size: len x wid   to represent a 2D array/the board
-each square will have its corresponding value, the empty square will be a 0
-constantly keep track/update the location of the '0'
	-an 'up' input should take the '0's index + wid and swap value
	-a 'down' '0's - wid """"""
	-a 'right' '0's - 1
	-a 'left' '0's + 1
note:
********
not all orders of values can be solved, have the code repeat n random moves, then check if it is at least k moves away from solved
********

-solve check: keep a solved array, and compare the array each move
